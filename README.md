   # Opens at http://localhost:8501
   ```

## 🎯 Usage

### Data Fetching
The `fetch_fpl_data.py` script downloads player data from the FPL API and processes it for modeling:
- **804 players** with **43+ features** including FDR calculations
- **Team strength data** for fixture difficulty analysis
- **Real-time updates** from official FPL API

### Machine Learning
The Jupyter notebook trains models to predict player points based on:
- Current form and historical performance
- Playing time (minutes) and cost efficiency
- **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **Linear Regression** models

### Squad Optimization
The optimizer uses **linear programming** (PuLP) to select optimal squads considering:
- **Budget constraints** (default: £100.0m)
- **Position requirements** (2 GK, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD)
- **Maximum 3 players per team**
- **FDR integration** for fixture difficulty
- **Team-specific position limits**
- **Expensive player strategy** (prioritizes premium players in starting XI)

### Web Interface
The Streamlit app provides:
- **Squad Optimizer**: Interactive controls for budget, FDR settings, team limits
- **Player Statistics**: Comprehensive stats with top 10 leaderboards
- **Beautiful visualizations**: Charts and tables with professional styling

## 🔧 Key Features Explained

### Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR)
- **Attack FDR**: How difficult it is for players to score/assist against upcoming opponents
- **Defence FDR**: How difficult it is for defenders/goalkeepers to keep clean sheets
- **Overall FDR**: Combined difficulty rating for balanced player evaluation

### Team Position Limits
Prevents algorithm from selecting too many players from the same position in one team:
- Max 2 defenders from any single team
- Max 2 midfielders from any single team  
- Max 1 forward from any single team
- Max 1 goalkeeper from any single team

### Expensive Player Strategy
Smart handling of premium players (£8.0m+):
- **Starting XI Priority**: Expensive players get 2.0x bonus for starting positions
- **Bench Limitations**: Maximum 1 very expensive player (£10.0m+) allowed on bench
- **Cost Integration**: Higher cost players weighted toward starting XI

## 📈 Model Performance

The machine learning models achieve:
- **XGBoost**: Best overall performance for point predictions
- **Feature Importance**: Form, minutes, cost efficiency, historical data
- **Cross-validation**: Robust training with multiple validation folds

## 🎮 API Usage

This project uses the official Fantasy Premier League API:
- **Endpoint**: `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/`
- **No authentication required**
- **Rate limiting respected**
- **Real-time data updates**

## 📊 Sample Output

### Optimal Squad Example:
```
Starting XI (£98.5m):
GK: Alisson (£5.5m) - Liverpool
DEF: Alexander-Arnold (£7.1m) - Liverpool  
DEF: Saliba (£5.9m) - Arsenal
DEF: Trippier (£6.2m) - Newcastle
MID: Salah (£13.6m) - Liverpool
MID: De Bruyne (£12.1m) - Man City
MID: Saka (£11.2m) - Arsenal
MID: Palmer (£10.7m) - Chelsea
FWD: Haaland (£14.9m) - Man City
FWD: Watkins (£9.1m) - Aston Villa
FWD: Isak (£8.4m) - Newcastle

Bench:
GK: Flekken (£4.6m) - Brentford
DEF: Konsa (£4.8m) - Aston Villa
MID: Luis Díaz (£7.9m) - Liverpool
FWD: Wood (£6.2m) - Newcastle
```
